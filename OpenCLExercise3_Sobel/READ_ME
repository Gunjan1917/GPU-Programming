- The MTF Implementation code is present in "OpenCLExercise3_Sobel/src". 

- Run "OpenCLExercise3_Sobel.cpp". Additional libraries required would be opencv_core, opencv_imgproc, opencv_highgui, opencv_ml availabe at "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu".

- Excel files would haven been generated in the project folder after successful execution.

- use "plot.py" python script to plot the ESF, PSF, MTF curve respectively.

NOTE - Since the creation of new project for openCL implementation is creating many errors, We used an existing project template "OpenCLExercise3_Sobel" and implemented MTF in it.
